# Bot Channels

Channels connect your Bot to various messaging platforms, allowing you to interact with it using your favorite chat applications.

## Concept: Unified Communication

Memoh acts as a hub that bridges different messaging services. You can configure multiple channels for a single bot, enabling it to chat on Telegram, Discord, Matrix, and more simultaneously.

## Supported Channels

Configure your bot's connections from the **Platforms** tab in the Bot Detail page.

## Configuration Flow

### 1. Adding a Channel

1. Click **Add Channel**.
2. Select the platform from the list.
3. Fill in the required credentials and configuration. The fields are dynamic and change based on the selected channel.

### 2. Common Fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Credentials** | API tokens, secrets, or bot keys provided by the platform. |
| **Disabled** | Quickly enable or disable a channel without removing its configuration. |
| **Routing** | Configure how messages are mapped between the platform and Memoh. |

### 3. Special Case: Feishu Webhook

If using **Feishu** in `webhook` inbound mode:
1. Memoh will generate a **Webhook Callback URL**.
2. Copy this URL and paste it into your Feishu App's event configuration.
3. This allows Feishu to send messages directly to Memoh.

### 4. Special Case: WeChat QR Login

If using **WeChat**:
1. After enabling the channel, a QR code flow is provided for connecting.
2. Scan the QR code with WeChat to link the bot.

### 5. Special Case: WeChat Official Account Webhook

If using **WeChat Official Account**:
1. Create and save the channel first.
2. Memoh generates a **Webhook Callback URL** for that channel.
3. Copy the callback URL into the WeChat Official Account platform configuration.
4. Keep the configured `Token`, `Encryption Mode`, and optional AES settings aligned between Memoh and WeChat.

### 6. Special Case: DingTalk Stream Connection

If using **DingTalk**:
1. Configure `App Key` and `App Secret`.
2. Save and enable the channel.
3. Memoh maintains the stream connection for inbound events; you do not need to manage a separate webhook callback URL for the standard setup.
